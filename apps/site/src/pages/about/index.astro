        J. Allan MacDonald writes fiction that blends the familiar with the strange—stories where
        the uncanny hides in plain sight and ordinary people stumble into worlds they weren't
        supposed to find.

        <h3>The Writing</h3>
        <p>
          His debut novel <em>Pointless Magical Relics</em> begins in a quiet Seattle bookstore,
          where an unremarkable old book draws the attention of two very different strangers.
          What unfolds is an urban fantasy with wry humour, creeping suspense, and a hidden
          world of relics, secrets, and subtle magic.
        </p>
        <p>
          More stories are on the way.

        <h3>The Journey</h3>
        <p>
          When not writing, he's exploring the world with his partner M.E. MacDonald—trading
          calendars for curiosity. Starting from Los Angeles, they're heading westbound through
          the Pacific Northwest, Cebu, and wherever the map makes room next. The places they visit
          often find their way into the stories.
