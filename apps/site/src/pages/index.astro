  <p>
    In <em>Pointless Magical Relics</em>, J. Allan MacDonald conjures an enchanting urban fantasy
    beginning in a quiet Seattle bookstore.
  </p>

  <p>
    Jen Winslow, a young clerk with a knack for noticing the odd, thought her days were destined
    to be forgettable—until an unremarkable old book draws the attention of two very different
    strangers: a familiar customer and a man who shouldn't be memorable at all.
  </p>

  <p>
    As tension coils between the shelves and the weight of the unseen presses in, Jen finds herself
    drawn into a hidden world of relics, secrets, and subtle magic. What begins as a quiet curiosity
    spirals into something far stranger, where the line between coincidence and fate begins to blur.
  </p>

  <p>
    With wry humour, creeping suspense, and just a hint of the uncanny, MacDonald invites readers to
    look closer at the objects we overlook—and the people who never quite belong.
