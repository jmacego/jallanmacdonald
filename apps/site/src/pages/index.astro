      <p class="hero-subtitle">An urban fantasy beginning in a quiet Seattle bookstore.</p>
      <p class="hero-description">
        Jen Winslow, a young clerk with a knack for noticing the odd, thought her days were destined
        to be forgettable—until an unremarkable old book draws the attention of two very different
        strangers. What begins as a quiet curiosity spirals into something far stranger, where the
        line between coincidence and fate begins to blur.

        "With wry humour, creeping suspense, and just a hint of the uncanny, MacDonald invites readers to
        look closer at the objects we overlook—and the people who never quite belong."

        J. Allan MacDonald writes fiction that blends the familiar with the strange—stories where
        the uncanny hides in plain sight and ordinary people stumble into worlds they weren't
        supposed to find.

        The places they visit often find their way into the stories.
