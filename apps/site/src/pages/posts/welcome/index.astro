    <p>
      In <em>Pointless Magical Relics</em>, J. Allan MacDonald conjures an enchanting urban fantasy
      beginning in a quiet Seattle bookstore.
    </p>

    <p>
      Jen Winslow, a young clerk with a knack for noticing the odd, thought her days were destined
      to be forgettable—until an unremarkable old book draws the attention of two very different
      strangers: a familiar customer and a man who shouldn't be memorable at all.
    </p>

    <p>
      As tension coils between the shelves and the weight of the unseen presses in, Jen finds herself
      drawn into a hidden world of relics, secrets, and subtle magic. What begins as a quiet curiosity
      spirals into something far stranger, where the line between coincidence and fate begins to blur.
    </p>

    <p>
      With wry humour, creeping suspense, and just a hint of the uncanny, MacDonald invites readers to
      look closer at the objects we overlook—and the people who never quite belong.
